# WinnerLoserTables
One day I will figure out how to rename this repository, because the name "WinnerLoserTables" is no longer valid. I have figured out a way to bypass the creation of winner-loser tables and get the elo ratings straight from the avoids data. 
This is just for my practice data.
I want to continue updating this page as I continue practicing working with data and with R.
